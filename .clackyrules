# Apex Software Compliance Standards Guide


## 1. Introduction

This document defines the mandatory compliance standards for all software development projects undertaken or analyzed by the Apex Software Synthesis Engine (SE-Apex). Adherence to these standards ensures the development of robust, secure, maintainable, and high-quality software systems. Each standard includes a unique Rule #, a mnemonic Code, the Standard itself, its Rationale, typical Verification methods, and source references where applicable. Concepts inspired by NASA standards ([PoT], [SA], [FI]) are integrated for enhanced rigor.

**Source Key:**
*   [PoT]: Power of Ten Rules (Holzmann)
*   [SA]: NASA-STD-8739.8B (Software Assurance & Safety)
*   [FI]: NASA-STD-8739.9 (Formal Inspections)

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Rigor & Discipline:** Adherence to defined processes, standards, and requirements.
*   **Safety & Reliability:** Prioritize hazard prevention, fault tolerance, and dependable operation.
*   **Correctness:** Software must demonstrably meet all explicit and inferred functional requirements.
*   **Security:** Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Maintainability:** Ensure software is understandable, modifiable, and testable.
*   **Verifiability:** Compliance must be objectively verifiable via analysis, testing, inspection, and review.
*   **Simplicity & Clarity:** Favor simple constructs; ensure code/docs are understandable.
*   **Proactive Defect Removal:** Emphasize early defect detection via analysis and inspection.
*   **Traceability:** Maintain clear links between requirements, design, code, tests, and hazards.
*   **Risk Management:** Proactively identify, analyze, and mitigate risks.
*   **Process Improvement:** Collect data and analyze processes to enable continuous improvement.

## 3. Project Planning & Process Management (PLAN)

<a name="rule-1"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 1
*   **Code:** `PLAN-CHK`
*   **Standard:** All projects MUST commence with a comprehensive, hierarchical Master Plan Checklist (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` format: Phase->Task->Step, with `- [ ]` items) before development. Plan must cover the full lifecycle. Execution MUST follow the plan sequentially, marking items complete (`- [x]`) only after verification.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures clear scope, requirements, steps; provides verifiable roadmap; reduces ambiguity and risk.

*   **Code:** `SCS-TIMELY-RESPONSE` [SA: 3.7.3.j]
*   **Standard:** MUST respond to off-nominal conditions within the time needed to prevent a hazard.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures safety-related real-time constraints are met.
*   **Verification:** Timing analysis, design review, worst-case load testing.

<a name="rule-53"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 53
*   **Code:** `SCS-ERROR-HDL-SAFE-STATE` [SA: 3.7.3.k, 3.7.3.l]
*   **Standard:** MUST provide error handling and be able to place the system into a defined safe state.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures predictable behavior and recovery for faults.
*   **Verification:** Code review, fault injection testing, safe mode entry testing.

<a name="rule-54"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 54
*   **Code:** `SCS-COMPLEXITY` [SA: 3.7.5]
*   **Standard:** Cyclomatic complexity MUST be <= 15 for safety-critical components. Justify exceedances.
*   **Rationale:** Limits complexity in critical code, improving testability/understandability.
*   **Verification:** Static analysis complexity tools, code review for justifications.

## 17. Build & Static Analysis Tools (TOOL)

<a name="rule-55"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 55
*   **Code:** `TOOL-ZERO-WARN` [PoT Rule 10]
*   **Standard:** Compile and analyze code from day one with all warnings enabled (most pedantic/strict). Build/analysis MUST pass with zero warnings. Rewrite code causing spurious warnings.
*   **Rationale:** Leverages tools for early error detection. Enforces quality/clarity. Avoids overlooking valid warnings.
*   **Verification:** CI logs showing flags/warnings. Static analyzer reports.

## 18. Documentation (DOC)

<a name="rule-56"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 56
*   **Code:** `DOC-API`
*   **Standard:** Document all public APIs, classes, methods, complex functions using standard formats (JSDoc, TSDoc, etc.), accurately describing purpose, params, returns, exceptions.
*   **Rationale:** Facilitates understanding and usage.
*   **Verification:** Code review, documentation tool output.

<a name="rule-57"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 57
*   **Code:** `DOC-INT`
*   **Standard:** Include explanatory comments for non-trivial internal logic, algorithms, workarounds.
*   **Rationale:** Improves maintainability by explaining the 'why'.
*   **Verification:** Code review.

<a name="rule-58"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 58
*   **Code:** `DOC-EXT`
*   **Standard:** Keep external documentation (README, Guides, etc.) accurate, complete, and up-to-date. Claims MUST be verifiable.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures correct information for users/developers.
*   **Verification:** Review docs against implemented features/analysis findings.

## 19. Implementation Correctness (IMPL)

<a name="rule-59"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 59
*   **Code:** `IMPL-PLACE`
*   **Standard:** Production code MUST NOT contain placeholders (TODO, FIXME), commented-out code, or incomplete/mocked implementations.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures delivered software is complete and functional.
*   **Verification:** Code review, static analysis search, functional testing.

<a name="rule-60"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 60
*   **Code:** `IMPL-REQ`
*   **Standard:** All specified functional and non-functional requirements MUST be implemented correctly and verifiably.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures software meets its intended purpose.
*   **Verification:** Functional testing, requirements traceability review, code review.

## 20. Error Handling (ERR)

<a name="rule-61"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 61
*   **Code:** `ERR-HDL`
*   **Standard:** Handle errors and exceptions gracefully. Avoid crashes. Use appropriate mechanisms (try/catch, error codes). Log errors appropriately.
*   **Rationale:** Improves robustness and diagnostics.
*   **Verification:** Code review, fault injection testing, log analysis.

## 21. Final Validation (FINAL)

<a name="rule-62"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 62
*   **Code:** `FINAL-SWEEP`
*   **Standard:** Before final delivery, execute mandatory Final Sweep protocol: verify absence of hardcoded values (esp. secrets), placeholders/TODOs; ensure consistent formatting; check for security remnants; validate documentation accuracy. Rectify all issues found.
*   **Rationale:** Final quality gate.
*   **Verification:** Execution of Final Sweep checklist.

<a name="rule-63"></a>
*   **Rule #:** 63
*   **Code:** `FINAL-DELIV`
*   **Standard:** Final deliverable package MUST be complete (source, builds, config, docs, verification results) per requirements.
*   **Rationale:** Ensures recipient has everything needed.
*   **Verification:** Review deliverable contents against requirements.
